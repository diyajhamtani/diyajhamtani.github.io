    <p>Hi! I'm Diya and I'm a second-year and Northeastern University studying data science and economics. 
       I'm from Braintree, MA, which is like 25 minutes south of Boston. I have a younger sister who is a 
       freshman in highschool. I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and hanging out with my friends. I'm excited 
       to take this class and learn more about data visualization! 
    </p>
    <p> Here's a picture of me and my sister!</p>
